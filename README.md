# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The prupose of this project is to analyze a city school district's standardized testing data to gain insights and key metrics. This includes analyzing the data on student funding and scores by aggregating testing data and showing trends in school performances. The school district's school board and superintendent will use the analysis in making decisions about school budgets and priorities.

### Problem to solve and analyze
The school board has notified that the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders have been altered. Therefore, the math and reading scores for Thomas High School will be replaced with "NaNs" while keeping the rest of the data for the high school. After making this change, the school district analysis will be repeated to see how this change affected the overall analysis. This analysis will then be shared to the school district and superintendent to have a more accuarate analysis of all of the schools within the district.
